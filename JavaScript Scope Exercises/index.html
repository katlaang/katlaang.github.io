        <pre class="code">
        x = 1;
        var a = 5;
        var b = 10;
        var c = function(a, b, c) {
                                    var x = 10;
                                    document.write(x);

            2. What is the difference between a method and function?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            A function is a block of code that performs a specific task or tasks. It is defined using the <strong>function</strong> keyword and enclosed in curly brackets. <br> <br>
            A method is a property of an object containing a definition of a function. i.e methods are functions stored as objects.

                function checkNumber() { 
                    console.log(num);

            var number = numberGenerator();
            number(); // 2
