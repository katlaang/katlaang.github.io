            <h1>Introduction to Servlets Quiz</h1> <br>
            <hr>
            <p class="question">Question 1: What is the difference between a web server and a web container?</p>
            <p class="answer">Ans: Web Server deals with the http request and response. but the web container deals with the Servlets
                and their life cycle. Request of any user first comes to the Web Server and then Web Server sends that request to the Web
                Container.
            </p>

            <p class="question">Question 2: What is a servlet?</p>
            <p class="answer"> Ans: Servlet is a java class with capabilities of server which handles requests from the client with
                the help of Web Container and Web Server. A java class extends HttpServlet. The HttpServlet class provides methods, such as doGet
                and doPost, for handling HTTP-specific services.
            </p>


            <p class="question"> Question 3: How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?</p>
            <p class="answer">Ans: Whenever a user request or want any response. Web server accepts that request and transfer that
                to Web Container and then Web Container deals with the Servlets life cycle. Example of Web Sever and Web container.
                Apache is Web Server and Tomcat is the Web container.
            </p>


            <p class="question"> Question 4: Who creates request objects?</p>
            <p class="answer">Ans:The servlet container locates the servlet, creates request and response objects and passes them to
                the servlet,and returns to the web server the response stream that the servlet produces.
            </p>

            <p class="question">Question 5: What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?</p>
            <p class="answer">Ans: <br>
                Step 1: Loading of Servlet.<br>
                Step 2: Creating instance of Servlet.<br>
                Step 3: Invoking initMethod<br>
                Step 4: Invoking Service Method<br>
                Step 5: Invoking Destroy method.<br>
            </p>


            <p class="question"> Question 6: Who calls init and when?</p>
            <p class="answer">Ans: init method is called by the container. It is called when the servlet is first created, and not
                called again for each user request
            </p>

            <p class="question"> Question 7: Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?</p>
            <p class="answer">Ans: We override doGet method.</p>

            <p class="question">Question 8: In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?</p>
            <p class="answer">Ans:There is no such interface as MultiThreadedModel. Servlets are intrinsically multithreaded. This
                means a single instance can be accessed by more than one thread.
            </p>

            <p class="question">Question 9: What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?</p>
            <p class="answer">Ans: Servlet instance variables should implement appropriate concurrency.</p>
